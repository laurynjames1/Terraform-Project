# COMMANDS SHOUND BE RUN CONSECUTIVELY

# Initialize Terraform

terraform init -upgrade

# Execute terraform init to initialize the Terraform deployment. This command downloads the Azure provider needed to manage your Azure resources.
# The -upgrade flag updates the provider plugins to the latest versions that meet the version constraints defined in your configuration.


# Create Terraform execution plan

terraform plan -out main.tfplan

# Run terraform apply to execute the changes defined in your execution plan and deploy them to your cloud infrastructure.
# This example assumes you previously ran terraform plan -out main.tfplan.
# If you used a different filename with the -out option, make sure to reference that same file when running terraform apply.
# If you did not use the -out flag, simply run terraform apply without any additional arguments.

# Apply Terraform execution plan

terraform apply #create resources

# Run terraform apply to execute the changes defined in your execution plan and deploy them to your cloud infrastructure.
# This example assumes you previously ran terraform plan -out main.tfplan.
# If you used a different filename with the -out option, make sure to reference that same file when running terraform apply.
# If you did not use the -out flag, simply run terraform apply without any additional arguments.

# Destroy existing resources in Terraform 

terraform destroy #remove infrastructure

# Run terraform plan with the -destroy flag to generate a plan for tearing down your infrastructure.
# The terraform plan command produces an execution plan without applying any changes. When used with the -destroy flag, it shows what resources will be removed based on your current configuration.
# This approach lets you confirm the destruction plan before making any actual changes.
# You can optionally include the -out flag to save the destroy plan to a file. This guarantees that the exact plan you reviewed will be used during execution.


# Execute terraform apply to implement the execution plan.

terraform apply main.destroy.tfplan
